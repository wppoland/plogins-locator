Show your physical store locations with a searchable, accessible list customers can filter by city, postcode or name.

== Description ==

Locator adds a simple, fast store-locator to your WooCommerce shop. Add each
physical store — name, address, phone, opening hours and optional coordinates —
as a managed location, then drop the `[locator]` shortcode on any page to render
a clean, searchable directory your customers can instantly filter by city,
postcode or name.

The free plugin is a self-contained, privacy-friendly directory: there is no
external API, no tracking and no map key required. Every location is rendered
server-side, so the list works even with JavaScript disabled; when JavaScript is
available the search box filters cards instantly in the browser.

**Features**

* Manage store locations as a dedicated post type under WooCommerce.
* Each location stores address, city, postcode, country, phone, email, opening hours and optional latitude/longitude.
* `[locator]` shortcode renders a searchable, accessible directory.
* Instant client-side filtering by city, postcode or store name — no data leaves the page.
* List or responsive grid layout.
* Choose which fields appear on each card (address, hours, phone, email, "Get directions").
* "Get directions" links open the visitor's map app using coordinates or the postal address.
* Accessible by design: ARIA live region for result counts, keyboard-friendly, focus-visible styles, screen-reader text.
* Core Web Vitals friendly: no layout shift, assets enqueued only when the shortcode is on the page.
* Dark-mode aware admin and storefront styles; respects prefers-reduced-motion.
* Theme-overridable templates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The free version is a searchable list (no map key needed). Map embedding is planned for the Pro add-on.

= Can I change the layout? =

Yes — choose List or Grid in the settings, or pass `layout="grid"` to the shortcode.

Yes. Copy `templates/locator-list.php` into `your-theme/locator/locator-list.php`.
